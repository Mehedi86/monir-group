            "While working in Singapore back in 2016, I strongly felt the necessity of a complete Technical Institute where appropriate lessons and training could be imparted to the desired persons who would be willing to go abroad for technical employment. We have a huge number of young intel- ligent educated and physically able individuals throughout the country. These young people if properly trained in technical and practical fields could turn out to be the assets of Bangladesh. They could be employed in the overseas missions and can earn a handsome amount of money and in the way, they could contribute to the foreign currency earnings in the national economy. After returning to Bangladesh, I started working towards building a technical institute. Finally, I built a technical Institute and named MSTC Technical Training Center which is being operated in the North of Capital Dhaka in an area called Dia Bari, Uttara. MSTC has been furnished with full facilities of Training on Construction Trades and Marine Trades. MSTC imparts methodical training on both a theoretical and practical basis. MSTC has been developed to meet the interna- tional requirements of the candidates and thus can face international tests and trials all the time. MSTC is fully complete and equipped with all training aids to make the candidates feel easy to work in any environment. Our students are now successfully working in Qatar, Singapore Malaysia, and other countries after passing all exams here at MSTC. Now there is a continuous demand for this technical training for young people willing to take the challenges in this coun- try or overseas. International testing agencies are always welcome in our technical institute for inspecting our facilities and test the standard of the candidates. I always feel our students are to be imparted the best possible training so that they can grow their careers in the best possible way to fulfill the necessity of their families and the Motherland.",
